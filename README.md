# Aether
Aether is a 2D real time tactics game based on pure Newtonian physics.
Fleets are constructed from 10 different ship hulls, which can be equipped
with various specialized weapons, sensors, fighters, and other systems.

The player has intricate control over various ship systems, power management,
repairing, etc. But the most important aspect of the game is managing the
momentum and positions of the units to gain a situational advantage.
The units do not have any maximum speed, and there is no fixed frame of reference.

There is a singleplayer campaign, plus singleplayer and mulitplayer skirmish mode.

Compiled binaries for Linux and Windows can be downloaded from
